This library allows to get the Jack polynomials in symbolic form. 
Schur polynomials and zonal polynomials are particular cases of the 
Jack polynomials. Schur polynomials appear in combinatorics. Zonal 
polynomials have applications in statistics, and they appear in the 
hypergeometric functions of a matrix argument.
